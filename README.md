# **DATABASE-NORMALIZATION**
In this process, a Database (usually a relational database) is structured in accordance with a series of normal forms to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.




The columns (attributes) and the tables (relations) are arranged to ensure their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. This can be accomplished by creating a new database design or improving an existing database design.




I worked with data based on my top 5 Nigerian albums of 2021. This includes albums from:
-	Wizkid: Made in Lagos
-	Davido: A Better Time
-	Joeboy: Somewhere Between Beauty and Magic
-	Mayorkun: Back In Office
-	Olamide: Carpe Diem




I transformed the Database design from the 1st Normal Form, to 2nd Normal Form and lastly 3rd Normal Form.




I made use of:
-	Python
-	PostgreSQL
